People who may have low vision, or may be colorblind, could encounter some difficulty distinguishing text from a background color if the contrast is insufficient. There are nearly three times more individuals with low vision than those with total blindness; and one out of twelve people has some sort of color deficiency. So, it is critical to consider adequate contrast between text and backgrounds."
